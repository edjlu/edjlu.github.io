<p>It seems like every big game developer these days is cashing in on the Third Person Open World Adventurer-Gatherer-Stealther-Ladder-Climber-Crafting Simulator.
You probably know the formula by now: lots of meaningless collectibles, climbable towers that reveal the map, side quests out the ass,
and a linear main story that can be put on hold indefinitely while you pick flowers or go bowling.
</p>

<p>Horizon doesn't really break this mold: at its core, it's very much This Exact Formula with a fresh
coat of paint. However, while it doesn't reinvent the wheel or redefine an entire genre, Guerilla Games' new IP
does put an interesting twist on the tried and true formula, carried mostly by the weight of its unique and 
satisfying combat.</p>
<h1>A Brave New World</h1>
<p>HZD is a game about shooting robot dinosaurs with a bow and arrow. At the outset, you're not given much info or 
backstory -- all you know is that you're a lil ginger girl named Aloy, who lives in a tribal society that apparently does not
like her very much. Probably because of the aforementioned ginger-ness. </p>

<p>The main story has you piecing together the details of your
past, while also slowly revealing things about the world at large, and answering questions about how it came to be (such as, why the hell am I fighting
these crazy-ass robots with caveman technology). Narratively, the story starts off a bit slow; honestly, it's not that interesting
until about halfway through, where a major development completely flips everything you know on its head. Luckily, that
doesn't really matter, because I spent the first half of the game being completely absorbed by the game's unique and frantic combat.</p>

<h1>Jurassic Park, But Metal</h1>
<p>Horizon's combat is part Mass Effect, part Dark Souls, part survival, as you roll, shoot, and craft your way through it's enormous world.
The real highlight, however, is its huge variety of enemies. From the lowly Grazer to the aptly-named Behemoth, each robot has its own unique attacks, weak points, and behaviors. The way you
discover and learn more about each of your foes is truly what makes the game so fun. 
I had some real palm sweaty, mom spaghetti moments -- when your plan goes to shit, and you end up on the run, nothing gets your heart pounding like when the machines start hunting <i>you.</i>
Each encounter feels organic, and rather than hold your hand and direct you through on-screen prompts or tutorials, the game kind of just lets you intuitively figure things out on your own.
As I played I felt like I was getting better – not because Aloy leveled up and became OP, but because I understood the game more and 
learned how to use its mechanics to my advantage (using the Focus to highlight weak points, learning the enemies’ attack patterns, etc). </p>

<p>This feedback loop of "get my ass handed to me > experiment and figure out what works > become stronger/better"
feels rare these days, and kept me hooked on Horizon long enough for the story to actually get good.
In my opinion Horizon nailed the difficulty curve, no easy feat – I played on Hard at first and switched to Very Hard soon after the tutorial. 
There was never a point in my playthrough where I encountered something that made me think “This is impossible, I have to go back and grind/level up to beat this.”
Yet at the same time, I never once thought to myself “This is a cakewalk, I could do it with my eyes closed.”
There should be something for everyone here – with 6 difficulty options that you can change at any time, it’s easy to tailor your experience.
</p>
<p>In similar vein, I’d like to shout out the fact that <b>you can completely customize your HUD</b> – every single aspect of it can be toggled on/off, or to only appear when necessary.
I still don’t know why EVERYONE doesn’t include this in their games. There is literally no losing here, because everyone can get what they want. But hey, what do I know… 
</p> 

<h1>A Few Minor Hiccups</h1>
<p>Despite the addicting combat and a plot that actually ends up being pretty well thought-out,
HZD is let down by some AWFUL motion-capture (or lack thereof).
Some of the cutscenes straight up look like they’re from the wrong side of 2010.
While the plot overall is neat, almost everyone else you encounter
is largely forgettable, due to a combination of bad writing, meh voice acting and the aforementioned 
facial animations that make it impossible to take them seriously.</p>
<p>
The open world is also much less interesting to explore than some of its competitors. The side quests are largely generic and
uninteresting, and feel like an afterthought. Going through towns and bustling cities, you quickly realize that you
can't really talk to anyone, and there's nobody to meet outside of your main questgivers. 
Most of the merchants are just called, "Merchant," and I can't help but feel like Guerilla got a bit lazy with the rest of their game.
</p>
<p>The collectibles are largely useless (except for the vistas, those were cool),
but really my biggest issue is that this game doesn't actually benefit from being an open world. Outside of the main story,
the only real other content is Hunting Grounds (challenge mode/time trial), Cauldrons (optional dungeons that allow you to "hack" machines),
and Bandit Camps (human enemies, who are about 1000% less interesting to fight than the robots).
If this game had been just 15 linear hours of the main campaign, I honestly think it might've been a better experience overall.
</p>
<p>Also the climbing is complete ass, but luckily you don’t have to do too much of it.</p>
<h1> The Frozen Wilds </h1>
<p>It's worth noting that there's a DLC expansion available called The Frozen Wilds. As the name implies, the expansion
takes place in a beautiful new region that happens to be cold as balls. I got TFW included with my purchase since I
had the Complete Edition, but I would highly recommend picking it up if you've played through the main game and 
enjoyed it in the slightest. It solves a lot of the gripes I had with the game, with significantly improved cutscenes/facial animations, some new and actually interesting NPCs, and of course, the same heart-thumping combat that the base 
game delivers. The new enemies definitely toe the line between "challenging" and "fucking annoying," but overall it's still
a solid addition to the base experience.

<h1>Verdict</h1>
<P>If you own a PS4, buy this game. It's like $15 nowadays. It's not perfect or a landmark game by any means,
but if you can slide under a Thunderjaw while shooting it with a shotgun and not think that's cool, you probably don't 
have a pulse.
