    <h1>Houston is an underrated food city.</h1>
    </p>
    <p>I grew up and spent the first 18 years of my life in Houston. It was only after I moved out that I started to appreciate the city's diversity. We've got everything from a bustling Chinatown to some of the best Texas BBQ, incredible Vietnamese food, Steakhouses, Ramen, Tex-Mex, you name it. I might not be a local anymore, but I like to think I know a thing or two about the city's food scene. There's something for everyone here, so I've broken my list of recommendations into different categories.</p>
    <p> (small disclaimer: prices might not be entirely accurate) </p>

    <h1>Tex-Mex / Mexican</h1>
    <p>This seems as good a place to start as any. Houston Tex-Mex restaurants are known mostly for their fajita platters, which usually feature skirt steaks marinaded in a lime-cumin-etc deliciousness mixture. Compared to traditional Mexican cuisine, Tex-Mex generally features a buttload of cheese - queso, for example, is a big thing here and can often be ordered as an appetizer. </p>
    <p>Besides that, most of the emphasis is on the aforementioned marinaded steaks and the absurdly large portion sizes. Everything is bigger in Texas, including our waistlines.

    <p>It's pretty hard to go wrong here, but I would recommend 4 restaurants to get started. <i>Lupe Tortilla</i>, specifically the one off Highway 6, has great fajitas and the Steak Lupe, an enormous slab of meat and monterey jack with pico de gallo. It's a hefty but delicious meal - I've never been dissatisfied by my food at Lupe. <i>Ninfa's</i> has multiple locations, but the one on Navigation is the original and still the best. Their steak fajitas are probably the best in town, although their chicken is lacking in comparison. Also their service is exceptionally fast.</p>
    <p><i>Torchy's Tacos</i> is a chain with multiple locations focused on big fuckin' tacos with wild ingredients. They're a bit pricy ($3-$4 per) but 2-3 should be enough for most people. Highly recommend the Trashy Trailer Park and the Baja Shrimp, as well as their Queso dip. The last restaurant I'd go for is <i>Escalante's</i>. I've only eaten there a few times but the main reason I come back is for their bacon-wrapped shrimp, which can be ordered multiple ways/as part of a fajita. Honestly though they're so good I usually just eat them straight up. They're as delicious and gluttonous as they sound.</p>
    <p>Worth noting, however, that guacamole/general avocado based things are not going to be that great here in comparison to say, Southern California. After all we get most of our avocados from there, so don't expect too much. Many restaurants (Lupe included) will serve bean dip instead of Guac, in addition to salsa.</p>

    <h1>Ramen / Japanese</h1>
    <p><i>Jinya</i>: Some of the pricier ramen you can get, but definitely worth the price of admission. They have base ramens that you can pick from and add/remove ingredients as you like. Usually gets pretty busy on the weekends. </p>
    <p><i>Tiger's Den:</i> Cheaper but almost always has a wait, as the restaurant itself is tiny. I think it's just slightly below Jinya, although I like the rest of their menu (appetizer/non ramen things) better. </p>
    <p><i>Gyu-kaku Japanese BBQ:</i> This is very similar to Korean BBQ if you've ever had that; they have plates of raw meat that you cook for yourself on a grill at your table. The grilling process is super easy, and even though it's a la carte and not AYCE, Gyu-kaku is generally a pretty good value, especially if you go during lunch. Also I think their house salad is dank as fuck.</p>
    <p><i>Hokkaido Sushi:</i> Honestly Houston doesn't have particularly amazing Sushi, this one is only on here because it's cheap as shit and a great value. Aka or Sushi King are good if you want higher end fare but honestly there are better sushi spots in much of America.</p>

    <h1>Chinese / Thai / Vietnamese</h1>
    <p><i>San Dong Noodle House:</i> My buddy's family actually runs this place. San Dong is a very affordable restaurant with delicious home-style noodles. Their whole menu is pretty good but the wonton soups are my primary recommendation.</p>
    <p><i>Spicy Hunan:</i> More of a sit-down affair, their extensive menu has everything from your standard fried rice to exotic meats like turtle and frog. Honestly this restaurant sits in the heart of Chinatown, and you could spend a few weeks trying all the different restaurants there. Just walk around the block and you'll probably find a restaurant that tickles your pickle.</p>
    <p><i>Thai Gourmet:</i> Thai food isn't quite as prominent in Houston but this spot on Richmond could give any other major city a run for their money. The atmosphere inside is actually nice enough for me to notice it, and they have a huge patio for outdoor seating. The food is slightly more expensive than other Thai offerings but it's definitely worth the upcharge.</p>
    <p><i>Pho Saigon:</i> Houston has a huge Vietnamese population and as such we get to <s>reap the rewards</s> eat boatloads of pho. Pho Saigon is probably the most well known joint in town but honestly any of the Viet restaurants in or near Chinatown are worth your time and money. You can easily get Banh Mi's for under $5 at most places. As it turns out, Pho is always delicious, even when it's 100 degrees and 80% humidity outside.</p>

    <h1>Distinctly Houston Offerings</h1>
    <p><i>Oh My Gogi </i> and <i>YoYo's Hotdogs:</i> These 2 food trucks are probably the most well-known in Houston and kind of started the food truck craze here. Both of them can often be found in Rice Village, late at night. Gogi is Korean/Mexican fusion; their whole menu is actually surprisingly good but they are mostly known for their loaded fries. Gogi has had many imitators over the years and I've sampled a few, but the main difference is that Gogi's fries are incredibly crisp and full of flavor.</p>
    <p>YoYo's serves only one item, a bacon-wrapped dog loaded with caramelized and crispy onions, a little bit of cream cheese, and some incredible Secret Sauce (I think it might just be sriracha mayo? No idea though). It's a huge and satisfying portion, however, and can be yours for only $4. Gogi's offerings are all $5 each. 
    <p><i>Taste of Texas:</i> The Rolls-Royce of Steakhouses. When you absolutely, positively, have to have the most delicious steak on Earth...accept no substitute. I don't really know what to recommend here; it's a high-end steakhouse. Pretty much everything is good. Just bring your wallet. And don't talk to me if you order well-done. </p>
    <p><i>House of Pies:</i> This place is a "Houston classic" for some reason although I'm not exactly sure why. It's open 24/7 and the pies are pretty good (as one would expect). The food is kind of just shitty diner food though if I'm being honest. Fantastic drunchies however, this and Whataburger are probably the go-tos for drunk food.</p>
    <p><i>Sweet Paris:</i> This place serves both savory and sweet crepes for all your French cravings. I'm not sure how authentic it is (probably not at all), but really I've only had good experiences here and I think they're reasonably priced + have pretty fast service.</p>

    <p>I didn't list all the good food that Houston has to offer because then this article would be 10,000 pages long. Most importantly, I left off Burgers and Barbeque - categories so large they deserve their own pieces. Until then, I hope this serves as a decent guide of where to eat if you ever find yourself in Houston.</p>
