<p>The all-you-can-eat buffet of video games. Vodka sauce, hold the sauce. The AC/DC of First Person Shooters, a true one-trick pony. When your one trick is this good, it doesn't even matter.
</p>
<p>Doom is the OG, the creator of the FPS genre, and the 2016 reboot of this old-ass franchise aims to capture everything that made the original Doom so great when it debuted back in 1993. But will this classic series stand the test of time, or has FPS evolved too far for old relics to survive? Step into your Praetor Suit and pick up your trusty old shotgun. Its time to <s>murder tons of demons</s> find out if this old dog still has a few tricks. 
</p>
<h1>OK Doomer</h1>
<p>It's refreshing to play a shooter that throws out pretty much everything I've come to expect from modern FPS games. There's no hiding behind cover, waiting for the strawberry jam on my face to disappear. No aiming down red dot sights at nameless SoldierDudes 50 miles in the distance, no generic slow-mo dramatic break-ins. </p>
<p> Instead, Doomguy runs and jumps like a goddamn cheetah, evading fire with his mobility rather than the "cower behind cover" button. You have access to your entire arsenal at once, and you'll need just about every bit of it. And true to its roots, your health and armor don't magically regenerate over time. Instead, you'll either have to find pickups scattered throughout the level, or execute weakened enemies with melee combat.
</p>
<p>Truthfully, I understand why most shooters have switched to some form of regenerating health. It allows you to take risks and play aggressively, since as long as you don't take too much damage <i>at once,</i> you'll be fine. But most importantly, regenerating health means <b>you'll always have enough health for the next fight.</b> You'll never find yourself stuck at a bad checkpoint, where you make a few mistakes and end up having to complete a tough section with only 20 HP. Doom, however, cleverly gets around this issue with the Glory Kill mechanic and the chainsaw. 
</p>

</div>


<p>Glory Kills turns each enemy you encounter into a walking health pickup. Once you've "staggered" an enemy, Doomguy can quickly execute them to regain some HP. Similarly, if you need ammo, you can use your Chainsaw to turn them into your own personal bullet fountain. The game very actively encourages you to do this, as staggered enemies will glow blue and then orange as you get in range. I think it's one of the best design choices I've seen in an FPS in a long time: Doom always wants you to keep moving, keep playing aggressively, and get up close and personal with your enemies, as all the resources you'll ever need are literally right in front of you. 
</p>
<p>It's this mechanic that really acts as a glue for the rest of the game. While I was worried Glory Killing would start to get repetitive, the animations are quick and varied enough that it never really bothered me. Doom is fast paced, with little downtime, so I'm glad that they went for a very, uh, <i>active</i>, approach to health recovery. </p>
<h1>Less Is More</h1>
<p>Part of Doom's appeal is that it's a simple, unpretentious video game. At the end of the day, it's basically just 13 hours of murdering a shitton of demons. However, Doom has a surprising amount of depth, and a less surprising amount of death. Gunfights in Doom force you to make lots of decisions, and to make them quickly and decisively. Which enemy should I be prioritizing? What weapon should I be using right now? Should I chainsaw a bunch of small fries to get ammo, or use all my fuel on the tough enemy who might kick my ass otherwise? These are all simple questions, but the frantic pacing means that you'll constantly be changing your answers on the fly.
</p>

<p>Story-wise, id Software seems to have followed the same principles. The plot itself is pretty basic and really doesn't need to be followed at all if you don't want anything getting in the way of your murderous rampage. I think they struck a pretty nice balance between minimalist, show-don't-tell exposition and mindless violence; there's just enough story to keep you engaged and to remind you that there is in fact an ultimate goal here, yet never drags on or overstays its welcome. If you really want to dig deep into the lore, there's tons of journals, codex entries, and even "The Slayer's Testaments" in the Hell levels for you to read through. Personally there's way too much text and I'm too lazy to read all that shit, but I appreciate that it's there for people who want it.</p>
<p>While the script here isn't going to win any Oscars, there's little tidbits that still make it fun to play through. Things like Doomguy smashing all the expensive equipment, literally 2 seconds after being told how to disable the machinery, are a nice touch of personality. Easter eggs like the collectibles, arcade games, and Classic Doom Levels add some variety and incentivize players to explore each level. The few characters you meet aren't exactly setting the new golden standard for video game writing, but they get the job done, and believably portray a corporation that's gone just a <i>liiiiitle</i> crazy in their pursuit of money and power.</p>

<h1>Time 2 Whine</h1>
<p>As is customary, I'm trying to think of all the things I didn't like about my Doom playthrough. But really there's not much here to complain about: the game is so simple and so straightforward that you'll most likely either love it or completely hate it.</p>

<p>There's one thing that stuck out to me as a big question mark: <b>Why in the absolute fuck is there platforming in this game?</b> Thankfully you only have to do it a few times, but there's plenty of evidence throughout the years (Mirror's Edge, anyone?) to suggest that first-person platforming is simply just not that fun. It's hard to tell where your character is in relation to the world and obstacles around him, and Doom's platforming is no exception: it flat out sucks and is significantly worse than the rest of the gameplay. I appreciate that they wanted some variety, but I think the collectibles and exploration are more than enough to break up the monotony of just pure violence.</p>
<p>Other than that, the only thing I can really think of is that there are too many loading screens and all of them take too long. It does kill the pacing when you're warping in and out of the Rune Trials, or when you die and get sent back to a checkpoint. Also, one time when I Glory Killed a demon, I clipped through the ledge I was standing on and fell to the bottom floor. But that only happened once, and I can forgive a single instance of a bug.</p>

<h1>\m/ \m/</h1>
<p>I almost forgot to mention - I'm a huge heavy metal fan and, unsurprisingly, absolutely loved Doom's soundtrack. I could see it becoming grating or annoying if you dislike metal, but really I don't think there's anything else I would rather have in the background while I decapitate demons with a chainsaw. Worst case scenario, just mute the music and put on your own. Or headbang on the corpses of your enemies, as God intended.</p>

<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>If you like shooters but are getting tired of the same old formula, take a trip down memory lane and treat yourself to some Doom. It's a refreshing, fun, and brilliant reboot of one of the most storied franchises in all of gaming. Even if you're not into shooters, Doom is a fairly easy game and is a pretty good value at $20.</p> 
    <br>I give DOOM 9 hellfucks out of 10 cupcakes. Hopefully I will pick up Doom ETERNAL once it stops being $60.
