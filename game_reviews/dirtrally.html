<p>DiRT Rally is a hardcore racing sim that caters pretty much exclusively towards the most dedicated of fans. While the DiRT series as a whole has been known for offroad racing and rallying, recent entries have featured a more arcade-y feel that's in line with most modern racing games. This game, on the other hand, focuses on providing maximum realism (you know, like a simulation) and offers support for things like steering wheels, pedals, and entire rigs if you're into that sort of that thing.
</p>
<p>Since I am just a mere pleb, I played this game with your run of the mill PS4 Dualshock. I've got pretty much 0 experience with racing sims, outside of the copy of Forza Motorsport 3 that came with my Xbox 360 many eons ago. I wasn't a huge fan of that game, but I do have an appreciation for motorsports in general, so when this game popped up on sale for $3.99, the rest, as they say, is history.
</p>

<h1>Don't Cut</h1>

<p>As the name implies, this game's focus is on rally racing. Rallies take place over multiple terrains and in varying conditions; you'll drive predetermined routes on gravel, ice, dirt, and asphalt, and have to deal with all sorts of weather effects. The different courses always keep you on your toes, and you'll learn (often through trial & error) what kind of speeds you can carry and how each car behaves in different conditions.</p>
<p>Roads are often very narrow, so rallying is more of a time trial situation; everyone records their own run, and at the end you (hopefully) have the fastest time. There are 2 other game modes, but we'll get to those later. The majority of the game focuses on the Rally mode.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice about DiRT Rally is that it's damn hard. When you first boot up the game, the menu will prompt you to select your preferences for your transmission, as well as for assists like ABS and Traction Control. By default, these assists are off, clearly communicating to me their intent. As I felt the game pressure me into not being a little bitch, I found myself forced to comply, although I did switch my transmission to Manual Sequential. I enjoy banging through gears, but without an actual clutch or rig I didn't see the point of going full Manual.</p>
<p>While the game starts you out with slower, basic cars with the option of FWD, it'll still take some time getting used to breaking traction and controlling your car, especially if you're new to the genre. On top of that, you'll quickly start to realize the importance of your co-driver, who gives you information about upcoming turns as well as any obstacles or hazards you might encounter during your run. It's worth your time to look up what the numbering system he uses actually means, because the first 30 minutes I spent in DiRT had me focused entirely on my car. Only after I flew off a hairpin at 100 miles an hour did I start to realize that he's there for a damn good reason.</p>

</div>
<p>As you log more seat time, you'll earn money to unlock newer, blingier cars. Of course, some of these cars are so powerful that they're harder to control, as they can break traction much more easily. I particularly enjoyed the RWD cars, which are challenging but fun to drift with, and the Group B cars, which are pretty much just rolling death cages. The grind to unlock more cars is basically the entirety of the game's Career mode, which is a bit unfortunate considering you can also play with any of the cars at any time by just making a Custom event. It's a bit spartan, but pushing the limits and taking turns faster and faster is addicting all on its own.</p>


<h1>Be Brave</h1>
<p>One of my favorite co-driver calls comes on a track in Germany. "Left 6, don't cut, be brave." This line is the essence of what makes DiRT Rally so fun. It's very difficult and sometimes frustrating; there's no rewind feature aside from just restarting the race (which loses you money), so any crashes or mistakes you make are permanent. Your vehicle also gets damaged, which can affect handling, pop tires, or even smash your lights at night, leaving you totally blind. Severe crashes can even completely disqualify you - ask me how I know.</p>
<p>But because you're racing against the clock, you're always pushing as hard as possible, on the very cusp of control. You go as fast as your nerves allow, trying to shave off even a second of time around that turn, despite the fact that messing up can add entire minutes to your time. While it's often a better idea to take the safe approach, as your confidence and skill grows you'll find yourself hustling through corners at higher speeds. Even if you've binned the last 5 turns, the one time you manage to perfectly drift through a gravel turn at 80 miles an hour makes you feel like a God. DiRT is so rewarding because it's hard, and because you know that you're the one fully in control, for better or worse.</p>

</div>
<p>If you get bored of the game's Rally mode, there's 2 other formats to check out, Rallycross and Hillclimb. Rallycross is more in line with your typical racing game: you do laps around a circuit against other racers in real time. It's fun, albeit short, and the cars they use are different from your standard Rally fare.</p>
<p> Hillclimb is a recreation of the iconic Pike's Peak course, and is essentially a rally set just on that stage. This time, however, you're without a co-pilot, which is a bit annoying honestly. I get that for authenticity's sake you're not supposed to have a co-pilot for this scenario, but it would've been nice to have that option. Learning the long and challenging course on your own is kind of a pain in the ass, especially since the cars used in Hillclimb are incredibly fast.</p>
<p>All of these modes are fairly barebones, with no real story or campaign, just "drive a bunch of different cars fast." Not necessarily a bad thing, as again, this game is all about the driving. You can tell how much effort went into the driving experience, from the realistic physics engine to the controller feedback to the fantastic audio design. I wish I could say the same about the graphics, which already look a little dated despite being only 5 years old. Regardless, DiRT is so fun to play and get better at that for the most part I simply didn't care.</p>

<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>I never knew anything about rallying before I played this game, but I'm really glad it exists. It lets the average person experience the thrills of rally racing, of white-knuckling the wheel as your car screams over jumps at 130 mph, without all the pain and death and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of expense. Sounds pretty damn good to me.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. More cars, more tracks, more modes, maybe a fleshed-out career instead of just grinding for shiny cars. But I guess that's what DiRT Rally 2.0 is for?
    <br>8.4 gaskets out of 10 wheelbarrows.
