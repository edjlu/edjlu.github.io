    Red Dead 2 is a conundrum to me. Even after 100+ hours of playing it, I'm still 
not exactly sure how I feel about it. On one hand, it's a monumental, breath-taking
achievement in world-building and atmosphere, and I don't even want to think about 
how much time and effort it took to make something so detailed, so meticulouly polished
and fine-tuned. On the other hand, sometimes it's so <strong>fucking annoying</strong> to play that I have trouble convincing myself to pop the disk in the tray.

If you've played Red Dead Redemption at all, know that this sequel is essentially Red Dead 1, but turned up to 11. What I mean by that is all the aspects of the original Red Dead, both good and bad, are present and expanded upon in RDR2. There's a lot to unpack here, and while this game is amazing, it could've been even better - dare I say even the perfect open world game. So saddle up, load your six-shooter, and start speaking unironically in your best southern<i> drawwwwwwwwwwl.</i> It's time to hit the road.
</p>

<h1>Red Dead 2: Electric Boogaloo</h1>

<p>For the uninitiated, Red Dead Redemption is essentially Grand Theft Auto, but set in the Wild West. You play as Arthur Morgan, a big badass who is very good at <b>A.</b> punching dudes <b>B.</b> shooting dudes and <b>C.</b> saying "boah" in a very hilarious and catchy way. Seriously, I still find myself calling random objects in my apartment BOAH.</p>
<p>Anyways, much like GTA, you're thrust into a short tutorial section, before the game opens up and generally lets you decide what you want to progress next. As you free roam throughout the game's 5 vast regions, you can get up to all sorts of bullshit, from mini games to hunting to drunken bar brawls. You can also find optional questgivers, "Strangers," throughout your travels, but progressing the main story happens only when you talk to certain characters, and the events of the story happen pretty much entirely separately from your free roam activities. More on that later.</p>
<p>You and Arthur are part of a group of outlaws, the Sons of Dutch, who try to escape from the law while simultaneously pissing off the law as much as possible. Chronologically, this game happens before the events of RDR1 -- fans of the first game will notice that John Marston, Bill Williamson, Javier Escuella, and of course, Dutch Van Der Linde are all present, and play important roles as vital members of the gang. It's really quite a treat to explore the backstory of the first game's main characters, but the rest of the gang feels dynamic and fleshed out, too. While the Van Der Linde gang has quite a few members, each one feels like a complete individual with their own wants, needs, and stories to tell. They do a great job at really feeling like a family, and they're pretty much your only allies in an unforgiving, dangerous land. </p>

<p>Speaking of a dangerous land, the world-building and atmosphere in RDR2 is one of its biggest accomplishments. Every little detail of the world as a whole, down to the most minute things, really lend it a sense of immersion that sucks the player in. Even the tiniest little details are here: when you rob someone and they toss your their coin, the coin has a little hitbox that can ricochet bullets off it in midair. You can watch vultures descend on carrion, or observe a pack of wolves coordinate to hunt down elk. The world feels alive around you, rather than feeling like  the world <i>revolves</i> only around your character. It sounds like a minor thing to get hyped up about, but it's the little things that add up and make a world feel really believable.</p>

<h1>Rooty Tooty Cowboy Shooty</h1>
<p>Let's talk about gunplay. After all, this is a cowboy game.</p>

</div>
<p>While the combat isn't exactly groundbreaking, it's still fun and satisfying mostly due to some great sound design and physics. Nothing beats dual-wielding some sawed-offs, and the ragdoll effects do a great job at selling the impact of each hit. The addition of the kill cam is really well done -- probably the only one that still hasn't gotten old to me - and Dead-Eye is still pretty sweet, letting you go into bullet-time to dispatch baddies with your magical aimbot powers. Shooting from the hip is a welcome addition too; while the gunplay isn't particularly deep, it does the job and is pretty damn fun. Special shoutout as well to the cinematic camera, a cool addition that I wouldn't mind seeing other games add.</p>
    <p>I will, however, advocate that the game is a lot better when you turn off the auto lock-on and switch to free aim. I had a friend come over to play this game once, and I noticed that, after switching my aiming back to lock-on, all he would do in fights was hide behind a fence and spam the L2 button. 
It was like watching someone play whack-a-mole, and when I asked him why he didn't go out and fight the enemies he simply said "Why?" </p>
<p>It kind of sucks that, by default, the game is so easy that the most viable option is to sit back and let the auto-aim beat the game for you. In my opinion, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to keep it like this - with free aim, you actually have to, you know, <i>play the game</i>, and as a result, use all of it's mechanics to win gunfights.
Also - compared to the first game, the aiming somehow feels more...sluggish. It took me a while to realize that in the settings, there's a lot of acceleration, and not enough sensitivity - fixing this made it feel a lot better. Maybe that's just a personal thing though.
</p>

<h1>Wot in Tarnation</h1>
<p>There's a lot that this game gets right. Fantastic writing and storytelling, a huge and immersive open world to roam, side quests and content that are just as good as the main story, great voice acting, graphics, sound design, and fun gunfights. These are all the things that made the first Red Dead great, and it's no coincidence that Rockstar expanded on them in the sequel. But what about the parts where it makes me want to punch myself in the balls?
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Things about RDR2 that suck massively:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Forced slow-walking in camp</li>
    <li>Having to open EVERY single drawer when robbing houses, general long loot animations that are unskippable</li>
    <li>Having to get my weapons off my horse, and having them reset every 2 seconds</li>
    <li>Can only store 2 hats (besides your default) on horse</li>
    <li>Outfit system in general is complete shit, seriously how tf does it work I still don't get it</li>
    <li><u><b>CRAFTING THINGS 1 AT A TIME ITS FUCKING 2020 TAKE A HINT GAME DEVS</b></u></li>
    <li>Having to clean my guns/horse/feed myself/general menial chores</li>
    <li>Horse sometimes really smart, sometimes just yeets into trees with no warning</li>
    <li>Controls are pretty shit</li>
    <li>Bounty/witness system is more or less broken</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Everything in this game feels so. fucking. slow. From Arthur's lumbering walk, to the endless unskippable looting animations that seem to take longer and longer, this is not the kind of game you just pick up and play for 20 minutes. While at first I was enamored by all the little details, the more I played the game my satisfaction turned into annoyance. While I appreciate that they were going for immersion, I can't help but feel they took it a little too far.
</p>
<p>RDR2 far too often dances between "my game is realistic and sucks the player into its world" and "my game is so realistic it's actually more annoying than real life." I don't play video games because I enjoy doing chores and performing routine maintenance on the things I own - I play them to <i>escape</i> doing those things, because being a badass cowboy gunslinger is a lot cooler than doing the dishes. I don't get why Rockstar had such a hard-on for realism in this game, to the point where they even sought to emulate the unfun parts of real life. I felt like many game mechanics were included so they could say "look at this cool thing we did!" But in doing that, they forgot to ask themselves: "Is this actually fun? Does this make our game better?"</p>

    <div class="caption">This game is best enjoyed as a marathon, not a sprint.</div>
</div>
<p>None of the above are game breaking mistakes, but one glaring issue presented itself multiple times during the main story, and it's one that continues to plague Rockstar's game design. While most of the game's open world is designed to allow you to do whatever you want, the main missions do a complete 180 on this philosophy; any options you might think of need to be tossed out the window, for you're only allowed to do EXACTLY what the game wants you to do. Sneaking in somewhere? You better go through the exact path and doors Rockstar wants you to, or mission fail. Parking your horse somewhere? Sorry, you gotta open up that minimap and find the EXACT circle to leave it. It's stupid, arbitrary, and overly linear for no reason, and it directly contradicts their own game design. It's confusing to players when, after the entire game conditions us to do whatever we want, suddenly the control is yanked out of our hands, and we end up feeling like NPCs just along for the ride.</p>

<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>I guess it's a testament to how good it is that, even despite my laundry list of complaints, Red Dead 2 is still one of my favorite video games, and one that I consistently come back to free roam in. If you like any of Rockstar's open world games, you'll probably like this one too - at the end of the day, it's pretty much GTA with a really, <i>really</i> nice coat of paint. If you're into Westerns at all, I also recommend giving this one a go just for it's story. It takes a while to get through, and is a long game in general, but I believe most people will enjoy it if they give it a chance.
