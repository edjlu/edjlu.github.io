<p>I'll be honest: I thought I would hate this game. I like my games to have a fair bit of challenge, but honestly, I'm not that good - I haven't beaten any of the Dark Souls games, never got around to beating Cuphead, and the only Halo I've beaten on Legendary is Halo 3, by far the easiest of the original trilogy. And make no mistake: Hollow Knight is pretty hard. But something about the difficulty feels more fair, more authentic this time around. It hooked me in, and almost 30 hours later I find myself still coming back to Hollow Knight to check out DLC content, despite having already seen the credits roll some time ago.
</p>
<p>This is Team Cherry's first game, and it's obvious where they took influence from. Hollow Knight manages to recreate the same tension and that euphoric feeling of finally defeating a difficult foe from the Souls series, but thankfully leaves behind the janky controls and gimmicky "haha looks like you didn't read the strategy guide" environmental insta-kills that endlessly frustrated me through those games.

<h1>Hallownest Awaits</h1>

<p>The first few hours of Hollow Knight are...underwhelming.  You're dropped into a world you know nothing about, playing a silent protagonist known only as The Knight, and given 0 instructions or objectives to complete. While you start out with just a basic attack and jump, exploring opens up bits of the world at a time. Like any Metroidvania, the map is huge, but you're rewarded for exploration through pickups that make your character stronger, eventually unlocking all sorts of spells and movement options. In my opinion though, the game is quite boring at first, and only starts to get good after you get the dash ability. Short attention spans, beware.</p>
<p>I'm glad I pressed on though, because the longer you play reveals an incredible world with deep lore, interesting characters, and a huge variety of enemies and bosses, all drawn in a lovely mellow art style. It's easy to forget this is a low budget indie game, because it looks so incredibly good. The soundtrack is a masterpiece too, with melancholic piano backdrops beautifully interlaced with fever-pitch orchestral symphonies for boss battles. Seriously, I never thought I'd be unironically blasting video game music for my workouts. But here we are. </p>

<p>Anywho -- Hollow Knight does a great job at introducing new mechanics at just the right pace, while continuously dangling the proverbial carrot in front of your nose. It always feels like there's something cool up that wall, or just around that next corner, and it's always something interesting or useful to your journey. Now that I've completed the game, I can appreciate not having all the options immediately dumped on to you, as it would simply be overwhelming. And while Team Cherry did a fantastic job building a rich and deep world to explore, by far the best part of Hollow Knight is how it makes you </p>

<h1>Git Gud</h1>
<p>This game doesn't fuck around. Nothing humbles you like dying to a wasp and a pit of spikes. Bosses are unapologetic about fucking your shit up and taking your lunch money. When you die, you have to go back to your corpse to retrieve your money, a la some other fairly obscure game that I'm sure no one's ever heard of. 
    <p>However, this difficulty (almost) always feels legitimate, thanks in large part due to some fantastic controls. I cannot emphasize enough how good it feels to play this game. The Knight responds instantly to your every move, has no acceleration so his speed is consistent, and can move while in the air. It's such a joy to get good at this game. Boss fights went from "Ah crap, I hope I saved at a nearby bench" to feeling like an intricate dance, as your Knight waltzes across the screen in a flurry of nail strikes and spells. </p>

<p>While Hallownest is filled with dangerous bugs who are very good at killing you, the Knight has a few tricks up his sleeve. Hits have knockback, so you can use your weapon to reposition yourself, push baddies off cliffs, or even pogo-stick off of opponents. Striking enemies generates SOUL, which can be used either offensively to cast spells, or defensively to heal yourself. As long as you can keep stabbing dudes, you'll technically never run out of health, provided you have enough time to heal. This allows the player to explore further on each life, rewards them for aggressive play, and presents an interesting gameplay choice: do I brute force my way through this encounter with overwhelming firepower, or play it safe and make sure I have enough to survive?</p>
<p>Your character starts with just a basic slash attack, but you might find yourself some new techniques if you look in the right places. You can also further customize your moveset with the use of Charms, small collectibles scattered throughout the world that can amplify your Knight or abilities in various ways. Charms are basically this game's talent tree, and the most meaningful way to customize your loadout. I feel like more could've been done here, but it does an adequate job of giving the player some freedom to experiment.</p>

<h1>Stuff That I Didn't Like</h1>
<p>To be fair, most of my gripes with this game are probably more directed at the metroidvania genre as a whole, rather than Hollow Knight in particular. I'm not a fan of backtracking and going back to places I've already explored, a cornerstone of pretty much any game in this genre. While I do like having a lot of freedom and agency while playing, I don't appreciate feeling lost, or being uncertain of what I should be doing next. I don't mind having to explore, and subtle touches like making the map not immediately available are a good addition. Rather, in each new area, you have to find a cartographer named Cornifer, who sells you a map. Things like this don't bug me, and give the game some unique flair.</p>
<p>The problem is Hollow Knight's world is designed to be open...<i>too</i> open. It's way too easy to get lost and end up in areas you're not supposed to be in, or fighting bosses you're not yet supposed to be fighting. What's most frustrating is that the game does a very poor job of telling you when this happens. The Watcher Knights are a good example of this -- a boss that you can encounter about halfway through the game, but really shouldn't be fought until you have a crucial lategame upgrade. Of course, the game never tells you, nor does it tell you that this upgrade even exists. It's this lack of information that can make Hollow Knight feel unfair at times, and can lead to a difficulty curve that is all over the place.
     <p>I'm usually big on not reading anything online, but this is the first game I've ever played where I actually started to enjoy it <i>more</i> after I began consulting a guide on which regions I should tackle in order. Which is a damn shame, because Hollow Knight's world is awesome and worth exploring, and there are so many different routes you can take to complete the main story. Sometimes, though, it's overly obscure and frustrating to navigate.</p>

<h1>DLC Stuff (WIP)</h1>
<p>Can I just shoutout how much GAME there is here, for only $15? I'm working my way through the game's 4 DLC packs, which were included for free (that's what we call value). I'll write my thoughts on those once I've gotten around to beating them.</p>
<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>The first two hours of Hollow Knight are pretty mediocre. Push through, and you'll find one of the best indie games I've ever played. While the difficulty can be daunting at times, and even discouraging, I'd urge you to take a break, eat some snacks, and come back with a clear mind. The eventual triumphs are worth it.</p>
    <p>I don't even like metroidvanias or soulslike games, but this is a game I still can't put down. If you have any interest in any of these genres, enjoy a challenge, or just have $15 weighing down your pockets, I absolutely recommend Hollow Knight.
