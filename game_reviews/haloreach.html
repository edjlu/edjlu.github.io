<p>Halo: Reach is the worst Halo game, at least of the Bungie offerings. ODST is a close second, but gets a few brownie points for its unique style.
</p>
<p>I was originally going to write about the Halo franchise as a whole, but realized I didn't actually feel like writing 6 entirely different reviews. Instead, I'm going to briefly summarize the Halo series, how it grew and evolved, and why Halo: Reach is one of the biggest letdowns in gaming history.
</p>
<h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
<p>I'll spare you the long and boring monologue about my childhood, and just let you know that I've played through Halo 1-4, ODST, and Reach on various difficulties (only Halo 3 on Legendary). I've played a good amount of multiplayer on Halo 3, Halo 1, Reach, and a bit of ODST's Firefight mode. If you know nothing about the franchise, here's a quick summary of all the titles - skip ahead if you're familiar.</p>
<p><b>Halo 1 (Combat: Evolved):</b> The OG, Halo 1 made strides for Console FPS by popularizing the concept of regenerating health and restricting your weapons to just 2 at a time. The campaign is intense with some surprisingly good enemy AI, but gets repetitive near the end, especially "The Library" level, which is one of the most blatant cases of copy-pasted rooms in maybe all of human history. Multiplayer is popular but Xbox Live doesn't exist yet, so people are restricted to just LAN parties.</p>
<p><b>Halo 2:</b> The Xbox's killer app and main driving force behind Xbox Live. Halo 2 introduced dual-wielding, finally getting to use the goddamn Energy Sword, and removal of fall damage and the health bar, which formerly did not regenerate with your shields. However, the game's release was rushed, which was incredibly evident in the campaign. Not only does the story end on a lazy cliffhanger, but the entire last half has copy-pasta sauce all over it, dragging on for about an extra 6 hours past its expiration date.
</p>
<p><b>Halo 3:</b> Bungie finally got the development time and resources they needed and put together the magnum opus of the Halo franchise. Halo 3 neatly ties up the trilogy, keeps all the QoL improvements from Halo 2 and expands upon them, and delivered by far the most complete and satisfying multiplayer experience. The addition of Forge mode, a rudimentary map editor, made for endless amounts of custom games and wacky one-off ideas. I got this game in 2009 and would argue that this was the golden age of multiplayer console gaming. A competent matchmaking system with rotating playlists, file sharing on your Bungie profile, and the unique game types like Bumper Cars, Infection, and Fat Kid had me emptying my pockets for Xbox Live cards like an absolute crackhead. They had me hooked.
<p><b>Halo 3: ODST:</b> Little did I know, it was all downhill from there. What began as a short DLC campaign was eventually expanded into its own title. As the name implies, ODST focuses not on the Master Chief, but instead on an Ordinary Dingleberry Shit Talker. Playing as a not jacked-up supersoldier definitely lends the game a different feel, punctuated by the gloomy jazz piano soundtrack and film noir look.</p>
<p> While the concept is cool and the non-linear campaign is a nice departure from your typical Halo game, the fact that the gameplay is basically the exact same as Halo 3 is a bit of a letdown. It would've been nice to see some new mechanics like stealth or traps or something, but instead you basically are just Master Chief But Slightly Worse, which feels jarring in comparison to the game's laid-back, quiet atmosphere. The lack of any new multiplayer besides Firefight is also disappointing.</p>
<p><b>Halo 4/Halo Wars:</b> lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooo</p>

<h1>Bare Necessities</h1>
<p>All the Halos are different but they share much in common. The main reason for Halo's success wasn't an amazingly well-written, epic story, or even the advent of Xbox Live. Halo's main appeal comes from its gameplay, which is simple and forgiving enough for beginners, yet complex enough to have some actual depth.</p>
<p>All fights in Halo are defined by the trinity of <b>Guns</b>, <b>Grenades</b>, and <b>Melee</b>. Generally, you can take a good amount of damage in Halo games, meaning fights will often last for at least a few seconds. Thus, the trinity comes into play: Melee does a lot of damage but obviously is the riskiest. Guns are the consistent choice but either have to be reloaded or can overheat after continuous fire. Grenades are best at taking out groups and vehicles, but take a long time to arm and you can hurt yourself if you're careless. Master Chief's campaigns are fun to play through, not because he's massively overpowered and can easily kill everything, but because he's versatile enough to tackle any obstacle, no matter what resources he does (or doesn't) have.</p>
<p>This trinity is the core of Halo's gameplay. There are clear advantages and disadvantages for all three options, and at any point you'll find yourself switching between - or even comboing together - your entire arsenal. It's simple enough for beginners to pick up: in Halo 3 multiplayer, one of the first and most intuitive things anyone can do is Shoot with Assault Rifle > Finish with Melee. Yet the ceiling can be nearly limitless, and the difference between a savvy veteran and a green newbie is always apparent.
<h1>Swan Song</h1>
<p>This brings us to Halo: Reach, the last Bungie title of the series. I don't normally write 15 paragraphs worth of foreword, but there does need to be some context for the things I will say. I still cannot fathom how a studio that developed 3 landmark titles failed to realize what made their own games so good. </p>
<p>Let's start with the obvious issues: <b>Armor Abilities</b>.</p>
    <div class="halopolaroid">
    <img src="../images/haloreacharmorlock.jpg" alt="stupid bullshit" style ="width:100%">
    <div class="caption">I haven't played Reach in like 8 years, but this picture still makes me angry.</div>
</div>

<p>This isn't the first time Bungie deviates from the "Holy Trinity" gameplay, but the results here are disastrous. <b>Sprint</b> doesn't seem like a terrible idea at first, but it completely upsets the balance by making melee, and by extension weapons like the Shotgun, insanely good. In games like Call of Duty, Sprint is crucial because you die in only a few shots - it's dangerous to move around the map unless you're sprinting to another safe spot. In Halo, however, the time to kill is long, but your mobility is limited, meaning that your positioning and awareness of your surroundings are more important.
</p>
<p>Sprint completely throws this out the window; any time you're in danger, the solution is to either stare at the ground (so you don't get headshotted) and run away, or to charge at your opponent and double melee them. <b>Evade</b> (the Elite equivalent) is even more egregious, and turns anyone with a Sword and half a brain into the fucking Terminator, as dudes double-roll across entire zipcodes to insta-stab you.
</p>
<p>But by far the worst offender is <b>Armor Lock</b>. Not only does Armor Lock slow the game to a crawl by granting 5 seconds of invulnerability on demand, it also completely counters Melee, Vehicle Splatters, Grenades, and every Power Weapon not named the Sniper Rifle. Of course, 5 seconds is long enough for your shields to start recharging, yet - get this - it ALSO shoots an EMP when you go out of Armor Lock, which drains the shields of anybody nearby. Why in the fuck does this defensive ability <i>also generate my own offense?</i></p>
<p> How did this make it through playtesting? It's the most uninteresting, un-fun counter to literally everything and there was absolutely no reason to not abuse it. It's like beating someone in Chess, until they press the "fuck you I win" button and drop 8 queens on the board. One of the last Halo Reach games I ever remember playing was a 4v4 Team Slayer, where the final score was in the low 30's, and we won based on the time expiring. Team Slayer games normally are just a few minutes long, and go to 50 - nobody could fucking do anything whatsoever because <b>we were all too busy sitting in Armor Lock.</b>
<div class="halopolaroid">
    <img src="../images/haloreachal1.jpg" alt="fuckarmorlock" style ="width:100%">
        <div class="caption">I'm about to end this man's whole career.</div>
</div>

<p>Armor abilities alone were enough to ruin the game - they don't disrupt the balance of the Trinity, they stab it in the face with a rusty tire iron and take a shit on its chest. Bungie's take on CoD-esque classes wasn't the first time they altered the Secret Sauce, however. Halo 3 had "Equipment," items that sort of functioned like Power Weapons, in that they were somewhat rare and had to be picked up on the map. The key difference is that, while Equipment threw a wrench into the Trinity cog and had a massive impact when used, they were deployed in a fashion similar to Grenades, and were one-time use items only. </p>
<p>Reach's Armor Abilites were inherent to everyone, had short cooldowns, and could even be switched upon spawn. The fact that everyone always had access to abilities that fundamentally broke the game and its mechanics is a dumbfoundingly stupid choice. Luckily for us, the trainwreck is just beginning.
</p>
<h1>The Opposite of Progress</h1>
<p>Remember all those cool gameplay innovations that Bungie worked on throughout the years? What if, hear me out, what if they just took all of those, and <i>threw them in the garbage?</i>
</p>
<p>That sounds like a terrible idea, right? </p>

<div class="halopolaroid">
    <img src="../images/haloreachhealth.jpg" alt="healthwhy" style ="width:100%">
        <div class="caption">Ah, good thing this game has...health bars?</div>
</div>

<p>For some reason Bungie decided to take the Apple approach, selling yesterday's product at tomorrow's prices. Health bars are back, which don't regenerate like your shields do. Instead, you have to search around the map to find health kits. I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea; one of the gripes many people had with Halo 1, especially on harder difficulties, was with getting stuck on difficult checkpoints with only 1 health bar. Even aside from that, it's not like scrounging for health kits is particularly interesting or fun anyways. 
</p>
<p>Fall damage also makes a return, because obviously the most thrilling part of Halo 1 was accidentally falling to your death. Not only that, they doubled down by adding <b>recoil</b> to the game. Nevermind that this makes absolutely 0 sense logically - you're playing literal supersoldier space marines who are strong enough to flip over tanks with one hand - but it also introduces unnecessary randomness to long-range fights and helps ensure that Guns continue to take a backseat to Melee, Grenades, and the ever oppressive Armor Abilities.</p>
<p>Reach kind of has ODST syndrome, where you basically just feel like you're playing a shittier version of Master Chief. I'm unsure why Bungie thought any of these were good additions- almost no game becomes more entertaining when your character becomes <i>less</i> powerful.

<h1> The B-Team </h1>
<p>I'm not gonna sit here and act like the other Halo campaigns were the pinnacle of singleplayer FPS. Master Chief isn't exactly a particularly deep or interesting character - he's literally just a generic space marine with a cool suit of armor. But he got the job done, shot a bunch of aliens, and said a few obligatory Tough Guy one-liners when needed. The campaigns were a little cheesy but certainly fun, and managed to tell an overarching story with an ultimate goal in mind.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Halo: Reach's campaign is some of the most boring, uninspired drivel I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. The game literally starts with you, dead as a fucking doornail, and Reach being blown to smithereens, so you already know that you're going to get your ass kicked in the end. The ensuing 10 or so levels is basically just a Most Heroic-Looking Death contest between you and your team.</p>

<div class="halopolaroid">
    <img src="../images/haloreachcast.jpg" alt="cast" style ="width:100%">
    <div class="caption">5 of the most generic, forgettable dickheads in all of gaming.</div>
</div>

<p>Your teammates, your partners in crime, are an elite group of the 5 blandest people in the entire goddamn universe. The cliches literally write themselves. You've got "stoic leader man" and his sidekick "black ops chick who clearly has/had a thing for him." "Eccentric loner sniper" butts heads with "hot-headed macho demolitions guy," but they're kept in check by "grizzled veteran who's too old for this shit." Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.</p>
<p>There's no stakes at all since you know the ultimate outcome, and it's not like you care about any of the characters anyway because they all have the personality of soggy cardboard. You don't get to meet any crazy-ass aliens like Gravemind, or Guilty Spark, or Arbiter, not even a Sergeant Johnson type comic relief, and the entire time I just couldn't give a shit about anyone because none of them were memorable at all. The jetpack section is cool, the jet fighter level was a welcome surprise, and the Defend the Alamo-esque last stand is pretty badass, but the rest of it is just so incredibly forgettable, plain, and meaningless.
</p>
<p>I know Halo is still being made today, and the Master Chief Collection is finally out on Steam, but it just makes me sad when I look back on the series. I spent so much time and got so much enjoyment from playing Halo 3 online, I really thought Bungie would keep innovating and pushing the Halo franchise forward. Instead, they took a few massive steps backwards, stumbled, fell off the proverbial cliff, and now they make Destiny.
</p>
<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>This game fuckin' sucks.</p>
