    <p>By now I feel like I've made clear my affection for the Western genre.</p>
    <p>The image of the cowboy, the lone gunslinger, is as American as apple pie, baseball, and crippling debt. No other time period has been romanticized as often as that of the Old West, which is a bit odd considering by all accounts it probably would've totally sucked to live back then. In a vast ocean of Western flicks, Godless markets itself as a primarily female-driven show, taking place in a town where all the men have died. While this promise is only partially delivered, Godless is still a solid, albeit short watch. </p>


    <h1>The Girls of La Belle</h1>
    <p>Even in the first few episodes, it becomes apparent that Godless is carried by a fantastic cast of characters. The show spends most of its time split between two plots, concerning the events of the once-prosperous mining town La Belle, the violent exploits of Frank Griffin and his gang of outlaws, and the inevitable conflict of the two. While the story of a man seeking revenge in the Old West isn't exactly new, it's propped up here by some great acting.</p>
    <p>The people of La Belle have certainly been through a lot, after a mining accident killed 83 men in one day. The remaining residents are tough and weary, but still communal; you really feel like the town's been through some shit, but they're hanging on by a thread and still in it together. The local law (Maggie, Whitey, and Bill) keep the peace but they've got their work cut out for them, as a town full of ladies is "ripe fruit for the wicked." Roy Goode, a mysterious traveler, enters their lives when he stumbles into the farm of Alice, a widow who lives on the outskirts of La Belle. She greets him by promptly shooting him in the shoulder. Rude.</p>
    <p>Unbeknownst to them, Roy is on the run from Frank Griffin, the show's antagonist and one of the best villains I have ever seen. Played by Jeff Daniels, Griffin is a terrifying force of nature: a vicious, menacing, yet surprisingly sympathetic and multi-dimensional bastard full of a sort of twisted faith in himself. In an ensemble cast full of outstanding performances, Frank Griffin might be the star. He delivers some of the show's best lines, and in this "godless" country he is the closest thing to God.
    He alone chooses who lives and who dies, and he carries with him a powerful sort of aura, a presence, that you can almost feel through the screen.

    </div>
    <p>Frank makes his intentions very clear early on, setting the stage for the rest of the show's events. He hires (forces at gunpoint) a writer to publish his decree: "Roy Goode betrayed me, and I will kill any man, woman, or child who harbors him. The good people of Creede let him walk their streets. And now they don't have any streets. Or people."</p>
    <p>As the story of Godless unfolds, we get treated to some glorious shots and amazing cinematography. Filmed around Santa Fe, New Mexico, the high desert is perfect setting for a Western, and the crew certainly went out of their way to capture that. Scenes like Alice and her son reading Roy's letter or Frank preaching on horseback to a captive audience are just a few examples of the amazing shots on display in Godless.  </p>

    <p>These sweeping shots are backed by a pretty decent soundtrack. I particularly liked the intro music, and the "Girls of La Belle" song that featured in the saloon near the end of the show. Aside from these pieces I don't think the audio work is particularly memorable, but it certainly isn't bad and fits the bill pretty well.</p>

    <p>I found myself captivated by the initial offerings here. There's a lot that Godless does well, with great writing, camerawork, some cool shootouts, and a slew of talented actors. The first 4 episodes are certainly worthy additions to the Western genre. However, the longer I watched, the more I started to notice the cracks and holes in an otherwise solid show.

    <h1>They'll Send You Straight to Hell</h1>
    <p>While I ended up liking most of the characters, I couldn't help but feel like some of them were under-developed. Martha, a mysterious German lady, gets about 5 minutes of screentime where an interesting subplot involving a Pinkerton detective is introduced. This is never explored again, despite the fact that Martha features prominently in the final shootout. For a show that marketed itself as all about the ladies, the women of La Belle don't get that much screentime. They feel like they exist because something needs to be at stake, as the rest of the show is largely about Roy and Frank. To be fair, I still liked all the La Belle citizens and thought they were well written/acted - it just feels like Netflix was being a bit disingenuous here.</p>

        <div class="caption">For a show about women, it sure spends a lot of time on everything except the women.</div>
    </div>
    <p>Bill, the local sheriff, also has an arc that feels largely pointless. He embarks on a seemingly suicidal one-man mission to hunt down the Griffin gang, in an attempt to restore his honor/self esteem, only to just come back home at the end and shoot them anyways. I get that he "found his shadow" and regained his confidence, but it just felt like a complete waste of time, as he didn't actually accomplish or do anything in his time away.</p>

    <p>The pacing of Godless also felt a bit off. For the first few episodes, it felt like you got a good mix of high-octane action and the slower burn of character development. In contrast, episodes 5 & 6 are pretty much entirely exposition/backstory, making them a slog to get through. I don't know why they decided to dump all the flashbacks into this small chunk. Other episodes had a few flashbacks peppered in, which worked perfectly fine. Instead, the episodes leading up to the finale are long, dull, and much less enjoyable than the rest of the show.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the finale, that's a whole 'nother can of worms...</p>

    <h1>End Game</h1>
    <p>Spoilers ahead, obviously.</p>
    <p>I've got mixed feelings about this one. I mean, it's no Mass Effect 3, but Godless certainly could've had a much better ending. I loved the cinematic aspects of the final gunfight: the buildup, the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, the hilarious Grigg's line where he, as always, exaggerates the truth. Even Whitey's death, while shocking, is totally in-character: he's cocky, arrogant, wants to play the hero, and is totally fixated not on the lurking danger but instead on making sure his hat and belt are straight. Of course, the real world hits him square in the chest before he can even react. Roy and Bill confronting the Quicksilver dickheads was badass, and the Shoshone ghost reveal/Bill "finding his shadow" were all cool in my book.</p>
    <p>What's not cool, however, is the way they handled Blackdom. You can't hype up a town to be full of big, hardened badass soldiers, and then wipe them out with a figurative flick of the wrist. Seriously, they had the jump and everything - you're telling me they couldn't even take out one of Griffin's guys? Also, why were they so ready to attack if they were literally debating the issue 5 seconds beforehand? None of it makes sense, and I feel like they were done dirty. I don't have a problem with the way that subplot played out - they were probably going to go down fighting anyways - but I do have a problem with them going out with just a whimper.</p>
    <p>In similar vein, I have a hard time believing that Griffin's gang had 0 plans for invading La Belle other than "dick around in the street for the entire gunfight." Throughout the series, they've shown that they are ruthless, cunning, and extremely fucking good at shooting people and pillaging cities. They were more than ready for Creede, for Marshall Cook, and for Blackdom; they had plans and knew what to do. So why, when they finally pull up for their ultimate prize, do they just stand in the middle of the street to be gunned down? None of them try to seek any cover, hide, or move to a better point, they just stand their ground and go pew pew while making mean faces. Yeah some of them ride into the hotel (which also makes 0 sense, but it's TV so I'll give it a pass), but the rest of them just wave their pistols around until they get shot.</p>
    <p>Let's see, what else...Frank's death is kind of confusing, I was really hoping there would be some payoff for the whole "I've seen my death" shtick. I guess there doesn't really have to be a point, since it really just made Frank more deity-like; I can see how it would make him and his gang fearless. But I was expecting some sort of reveal, although Roy's one-liner before he kills him is almost badass enough to make up for it.</p>
    <p>Oh right, I was also hoping for Roy to bring Alice and her family with him. The chemistry there is obvious (I mean she literally jumped his bones), but instead she just randomly takes Bill back without a word, despite showing him virtually 0 affection for the entire show. There's almost no scenes that indicate Alice would choose this, and it ends up feeling weird and forced, like they decided on this before the show even started but failed to adapt the script. Also the "Thank you" note was so bad I genuinely laughed out loud, it looks like fucking Eeyore wrote it.</p>
    <p>Endings are always one of the biggest challenges, for games, TV, and movies alike. While Godless doesn't have the worst ending ever, I feel it was ultimately a let-down compared to the show's strong start.</p>


    
    
    <h1>Verdict</h1>
    <p>If you're not a fan of Westerns, Godless probably won't change your mind. Although it's marketed as a female-driven Western, don't be fooled; it's really just a Western revenge flick with some chicks thrown in as collateral. That being said, it's got some killer cinematography, cool gunfights, and some amazing performances from the whole cast. Despite its issues, I would recommend Godless to anyone who likes Westerns or just needs a short series to binge.</p>
    <p>
    6.5/10 overall, 8/10 if you only watch the first 4 episodes.</p>
