<h4>I have eaten a LOT of burgers in my life.</h4>
<p>I've had burgers in China. I've had burgers in London (unfortunately). I've had burgers in Hawaii, New York, and all along the West Coast. And of course, I have had many burgers in my hometown of Houston, Texas. </p>
<p> The best burger I've ever eaten comes from a little Houston chain called Becks Prime.

    <p>Becks is the kinda place you can smell from the parking lot. It smells of lovely hickory smoke and, depending on which location you go to, pine trees from their enormous outdoor dining area. </p>
    <p>For many Houstonians, Becks Prime could be considered overpriced. It's definitely toeing the line between fast food restaurant and, uh, actual restaurant, I guess. I used to consider it a bit overpriced as well, although everywhere I've been since then would suggest that paying over $10 for a burger is actually the norm. Regardless, it's worth the cost of admission, and if Becks Prime ever expanded out here to Los Angeles, I would <b>A.</b> be shocked if they didn't wipe the floor with every other burger chain and <b>B.</b> become a lot fatter. And poorer. </p>

<h1>Keep it Simple, Stupid</h1>
<p>What makes a Becks Prime burger so good?</p>
<p>Well, they don't do anything too crazy. There's no wild, outlandish ingredients to design a never-before-seen burger. Instead, they just...do everything perfectly. The buns are soft and delicious on their own, veggies are always super fresh. The patty is a work of art - always perfectly smoky, cooked to whatever done-ness you prefer. It melts in your mouth and is always consistent - much like Lupe, I've <i>never</i> eaten a bad burger at Becks. And much like Lupe, I always go out of my way to eat at Becks when I'm home.</p>

    <div class="caption">I mean, look at this thing.</div>
</div>
<p>Their burgers are simple, but for burgers more than any other food, simple is better. I know what I want when I get a burger - I don't want fucking caviar, or gold flakes, or lobster dicks, or whatever stupid bullshit people put on their "fusion" burgers and shit nowadays. All a burger needs is some well-cooked beef, cheese, 2 tasty buns, fresh veg, and sauce. That's it.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there, though. The menu is pretty solid, top to bottom. Even the salads here (don't laugh, my mom ordered them ok) are actually pretty good. Their fries are, at worst, top 3 I've ever had, but if you fancy baked potatoes or onion rings those hit the spot, too. If you're really feeling fancy, you can try out their steak dinners. I wouldn't (and never have - it's not like there's not good steakhouses in Houston), but honestly I wouldn't be shocked if it was pretty decent anyways. </p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>There are lots of great burgers out there. In terms of value, In-N-Out is untouchable. Hopdoddy's is a solid choice for those who want to spend a bit less dough than Becks. Shake Shack and Five Guys aren't too shabby either, although Five Guys is a little too greasy for me. But if you want the Cadillac of burgers, go to Becks Prime and get a Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of fries.</p>
<p>And send me some, too.
